# [PITA.TECH](#)

I think it's my blog.

Pretty sure, actually.

Built with [Vue.js](). Based on (and originally cloned from) [Gridsome Blog Starter](https://gridsome.org/starters/gridsome-blog-starter/).

I plan on writing tech-related content, sometimes hands-on coding and occasionaly about the industry and how it interacts with our privacy and ethics.
